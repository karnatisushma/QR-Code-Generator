# QR-Code-Generator
Generates QR code

QR stands for Quick Response, and it gained its name from how quickly a cell phone can read it. They are used on your phone to collect and store data from moving media.

To generate QR codes, weâ€™ll use the Python package QRcode and Tkinter for the GUI application. Here is the pip command to use to install this package:
pip install qrcode

Usage:
Run the script using Python, and provide the text or numerical input as a command-line argument. The script will generate a QR code and save it as an image file in the same directory.
python qr_code_generator.py "Your input text or number"
